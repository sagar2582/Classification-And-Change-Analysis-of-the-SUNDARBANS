# Classification-And-Change-Analysis-of-the-SUNDARBANS

Must have band 4 and band 5 LANDSAT images from USGS Earth Explorer of two different years of the same location where you want to find the change in land/forest cover.
After following each instruction step by step and not changing any file type you will have a shape file and a projection file as an output.
Use QGIS software to export it as a KML file and use the google earth engine on your PC to see the change in land/forest cover.
